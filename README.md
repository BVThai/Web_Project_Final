**English Center Management System Project**

In this project, I developed an English center management system with the main functions as follows:

**For students:**  
- View class and course schedules.  
- Register, purchase, and pay for selected courses.  
- Attend online classes conducted by center teachers.  
- Receive notifications and assignments from teachers in registered classes.  
- Take English quizzes.

**For teachers:**  
- Manage students in their assigned classes.  
- Conduct online classes according to the teaching schedule.  
- Post necessary announcements for the classes.

**For administrators:**  
- Add, delete, and update information about students, teachers, and courses.  
- Manage all classes and assign teachers to appropriate classes.

The system is designed to optimize management processes, enhance teaching and learning efficiency, and create a convenient and flexible learning environment for students.

**Technologies used:**  
- FrontEnd: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript.  
- BackEnd: PHP, Laravel, API (for creating meetings).  
- Database: SQLServer.
